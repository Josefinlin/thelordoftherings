# Assignment - style your own website
This is an assignment for the course "digital techniques and production". You are given a easy template of a webpage. Your assignment is to change the CSS to make it as beautiful as you want! Now, CSS isn't always easy even if it feels like it. You are more than welcome to ask each others and Google things you want to do. Add `CSS` to every search you do to make it easy for example "css change background color". Copy and paste. That's how we roll. Really.

## Setting up the project
1. One of you downloads this repository as a zip-file to your computer.
2. Save the folder somewhere where you easily can find it again. For example `/documents/sites` or on the desktop.
3. If you double click the `index.html` file you will open the page in your default browser. You can now see how the page looks like.
4. Open the application VS Code. 
5. In VS Code, go under "file" > "open project" and select your folder that you have downloaded from Github.
6. To check if all works: click on `index.html` in VS Code to open the file in VS Code.

10. In VS Code press button "live share" and share the link to the other person. If needed - login with you Github account.

## Requirements
So now it's time for you to start programming! You decide yourself on how much you want to change. We don't have this assignment to make you programmers - it's for you to understand what programming is. But we need to have some requirements. Here they are.
